# üìä Baby Names SQL Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes the **U.S. Baby Names dataset** using SQL.  
It covers everything from **database creation, data ingestion, and cleaning** to **advanced analytical queries**.  
The results are also visualized with charts for better storytelling.

## üéØ Goals of the Project
- Create and manage a relational database for baby names  
- Import and clean data from CSV files  
- Explore naming trends over time, across regions, and by gender  
- Answer key questions such as:  
  - What are the most popular male and female names?  
  - How have names like *Jessica* and *Michael* changed over time?  
  - Which names are androgynous?  
  - What regions show unique naming patterns?  
  - What are the shortest and longest popular names?

## üìÇ Database Setup & Code

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Database and Tables
```sql
-- Create new database
CREATE DATABASE baby_names_db;
USE baby_names_db;

-- Table for cleaned baby names
CREATE TABLE names (
  State CHAR(2),
  Gender CHAR(1),
  Year INT,
  Name VARCHAR(45),
  Births INT
);

-- Table for staging raw CSV data
CREATE TABLE names_staging (
  State NVARCHAR(10),
  Gender NVARCHAR(10),
  Year NVARCHAR(10),
  Name NVARCHAR(100),
  Births NVARCHAR(100)
);
2Ô∏è‚É£ Load Data from CSV
sql
Copy code
-- Insert data into staging table
BULK INSERT names_staging
FROM 'D:\project retail\US+Baby+Names+MySQL (1)\names_data.csv'
WITH (
    FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
    ROWTERMINATOR = '\n',
    FIRSTROW = 2,
    CODEPAGE = '65001',
    TABLOCK
);

-- Clean data and move into final table
INSERT INTO names (State, Gender, Year, Name, Births)
SELECT 
    State,
    Gender,
    TRY_CAST(Year AS INT),
    Name,
    ISNULL(TRY_CAST(REPLACE(Births, ',', '') AS INT), 0)
FROM names_staging;
   3Ô∏è‚É£ Create Regions Table
   CREATE TABLE regions (
